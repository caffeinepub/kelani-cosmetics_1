  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via a desktop-only Tailwind arbitrary property on the banner background. REQ-2 appears addressed by removing the desktop max-width constraint on the SearchBar container (mobile still constrained). REQ-3 is partially implemented (stacking count on mobile, smaller styles, smaller mobile link font), but the diff does not show CSS-based no-wrap truncation with ellipsis to prevent wrapping on narrow screens. An unrequested change limits the number of products shown on mobile to 4.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "On mobile (<768px), truncate long category names to a single line (no wrapping) with an ellipsis to prevent wrapping.",
      "reason": "The diff truncates the string in JS (`substring(0, 22) + '...'`) but does not apply Tailwind/CSS no-wrap + ellipsis truncation utilities (e.g., `truncate` / `whitespace-nowrap` / `overflow-hidden`). Without those, the title can still wrap on narrow screens, violating the 'single line (no wrapping)' acceptance criterion.",
