  "summary": "Implemented static public sitemap.xml and robots.txt files and added a custom React-based head-tag manager (SeoHead) with per-route SEO presets applied to Home, Contacto, and Privacy pages. However, the diff also shows additional non-SEO behavioral logic added to PrivacyPage that may violate the “no behavior/UI changes outside head management” constraint.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest constraints/non-goals specify no changes to existing page behavior or UI content outside of head tag management and the two new static public files. The diff shows additional effects/state and conditional rendering logic unrelated to SEO tags.",
