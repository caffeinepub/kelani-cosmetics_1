  "summary": "Diff introduces a new `contentClassName` prop on `SafeSelect` and applies it to the Admin Products category filter dropdown, but the provided diff excerpts do not show (a) `SafeSelect` actually wiring that prop to the rendered `SelectContent`, (b) the same styling being applied to the ProductUpsertModal category dropdown, or (c) the required admin-scoped CSS class being appended in `index.css` to enforce max-height/scrollbar/touch scrolling.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add an opt-in way to style the dropdown menu container for SafeSelect so specific callers can apply a max-height and scrolling without changing default behavior of other selects.",
      "reason": "While `SafeSelectProps` includes `contentClassName?: string` and callers can pass it, the diff snippet is truncated before showing that `contentClassName` is actually applied to the rendered `SelectContent` element; therefore the key acceptance criterion (class applied specifically to SelectContent) is not evidenced.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Apply the same max-height (10 items) + vertical scrolling behavior to the category selection dropdown inside the Add/Edit Product modal (ProductUpsertModal).",
      "reason": "The `ProductUpsertModal.tsx` diff excerpt is truncated and does not show the category `SafeSelect` usage nor any `contentClassName=\"admin-category-select-content\"` (or equivalent) being applied there.",

        "frontend/src/components/admin/products/ProductUpsertModal.tsx (truncated)"

      "requirement": "Create new, admin-specific CSS styles to implement the scrollable dropdown menu (max-height, overflow-y) and a clean scrollbar; include touch momentum scrolling; append styles without modifying the existing :root CSS block in frontend/src/index.css.",
      "reason": "The `index.css` excerpt shown contains the existing base and toast styles, but does not include evidence of a newly appended, uniquely-scoped admin dropdown class (e.g., `.admin-category-select-content`) setting max-height/overflow-y, `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`, and scoped scrollbar styling.",
