  "summary": "The diff shows changes beyond the allowed single-component scope, and it appears to modify the stock overlay badge content in ProductCard.tsx, which was required to remain unchanged. Due to truncation, the price-UI removal and removal of the below-price stock text block cannot be fully verified from the provided snippet.",
