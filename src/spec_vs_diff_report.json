  "summary": "Frontend PublicHeader changes implement the requested hamburger size reduction and Contact link padding removal. Backend change for making getProductsPageFeaturedFirst public is not evidenced in the provided backend diff (truncated before product methods), so REQ-1 cannot be verified as implemented. Additionally, the header button aria-label is Spanish, which conflicts with the constraint to use English for new/modified user-facing text.",
