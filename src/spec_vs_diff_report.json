  "summary": "REQ-1 is not verifiably implemented from the provided truncated diff, and the diff shows multiple unrelated changes to the Privacy page (loading/error states, actor hooks, SEO side effects, header/back link, and dynamic last-updated date), plus modifications to non-requested files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "On /privacy, update only Section 12 \"Contacto\" to remove hardcoded store contact details and replace with the specified paragraph and a standalone @tanstack/react-router Link to /contacto, without changing other sections or adding loading/error/data-fetch patterns.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet for PrivacyPage.tsx is truncated before Section 12, so there is no evidence that the Section 12 content was updated as specified (removal of the `bg-muted p-6 rounded-lg space-y-3` div, removal of mailto/tel/details, exact paragraph text, and exact Link text/className). Additionally, the visible changes indicate broader modifications to the page beyond Section 12, which violates the 'update only Section 12' constraint in REQ-1.",
