However, the mobile-only banner height reduction (REQ-12) is not evidenced in the provided index.css diff, and the category pagination/append semantics required by REQ-10 cannot be confirmed from the diff summary (hook logic not shown).",

      "requirement": "Each scroll trigger loads and appends exactly 5 additional categories without replacing/resetting existing ones; preserve backend ordering; track total/hasMore correctly; avoid duplicates.",
      "reason": "The component passes a pageSize of 5 into the hook, but the diff does not show the hook implementation or any explicit logic proving that each trigger appends exactly 5 additional categories, maintains ordering by the order field, prevents duplicates, and correctly computes hasMore/total.",

      "reason": "The diff shows the :root block and other CSS, but does not show any appended media-query CSS that adjusts the .store-banner (or banner) height on mobile; StoreBanner was changed to use className=\"store-banner\" but no corresponding CSS change is evidenced.",
